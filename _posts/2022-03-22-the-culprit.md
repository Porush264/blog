What does it give to matter\
And deserve something much greater\
You just cannot see yourself as free\
Free from pressure that makes you feel like a creep

\
The pain I feel inside \
Does not seem to go \
To let me live freely\
You feel like a loser\
Who has tried all his life \
But now only has the will to give up and die\
You see everyone else happy and satisfied\
With what they possess and sincerely lack\
Then you see yourself and question why\
It is the way it has been from a long time\
The fear which has lived inside your mind\
Continues this cycle like an endless tide

The struggles have worn you out \
Still you continue to live \
Hoping for an end to this pain and ache\
But the blame keeps returning for you to carry \
Of the situation you have placed yourself in comfortably
