A mystery yet left to be completely understood\
But could be made by shrinking a body to vacuum\
The only one to emerge victorious against light \
and also the one who slows down the course of time\
Contradictory itself to its own name\
As it shines brighter in every way\
Present at the center of almost every galaxy\
surging its dominance as a universal beauty\
They come in sizes of different kinds\
As size is not the criteria required \
Gravity and spacetime which cross the line\
For causes affecting the formation of this universal giant\
No one knows what lies at the other end\
But people imagine a door to another realm\
Sometimes born from the destruction of stars\
does not die without leaving its mark\
General relativity by Einstein acts as its evidence\
But visual proof came in the form of M-87\
Black hole might be the scientific name given \
But more suitable would be the point of 'no return'
