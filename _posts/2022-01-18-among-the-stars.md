Stardust flows across the universe\
Inviting me to explore its wonders\
And when I greet it as a stranger\
I see reflection of my own true nature\
A nature looking for exploration far ,far away\
As I feel like a stranger on the land I lay everyday\
So as long as there are stars above me\
I don't need nobody else for me\
Cause they're the only one that matter to me\
But as I begin this journey alone\
I promise the ones I leave behind that someday I will return home
