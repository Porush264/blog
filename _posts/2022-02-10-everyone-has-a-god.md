God is a concept of mind and belief \
Some people believe in God for the sake of hope\
Some believe for well-wish of their own \
While some people like to think they do not believe at all

People believe that their god is immutable\
But fail to see that change in itself is unpredictable \
Some people believe in an immaterial God\
While some are deceived by statues of gold\
And some people pretend they do not have time for it all\
But one thing they all share and bring forth \
Is the false sense of faith and an idea of hope

Religion is a concept of utter confusion\
Some use it to believe\
Some use it to deceive\
While some just use it to make them fit in\
 \
It tends to confuse everyone with its different rules\
Which makes people stop questioning and live a life of fool\
They build their temples to promote their system\
And make a false history to fit a senseless conclusion\
What they forget to bring is a voice of reason\
And tend to destroy peace and enforce a life of commotion\
in order to find a purpose and a life of emotion
