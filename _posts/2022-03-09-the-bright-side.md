Everything could not go more perfectly\
As I see an undeniable beauty in everything I see\
I see the frequencies of human emotions\
Resonating at odd proportions\
As I feel delighted at my circumstances\
Which sparkle a hope for tomorrow's chances\
And although all these people in my life might go on different paths\
The memories I made with them will forever go on to live in my heart\
Memories might be the only thing which withstand the course of time\
As they act as final remembrance of emotions we felt inside\
I feel free as a kite soaring endlessly in the sky\
And I just hope no one cuts the string to my ray of light\
The brightness in the sunny sky \
Matches paralleled to my peace of mind
