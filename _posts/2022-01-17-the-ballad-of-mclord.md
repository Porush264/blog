There once was a man named McLord \
And nobody was present in his town who wasn't known\
For their bravery and their traditional folklores\
But now he was in a foreign soil all on his own\
And he had troubles for long\
As he faced rejection whenever he tried and told\
His feelings related to his sense of living alone\
But there was still present a glimmer of hope\
Till as long as he could remember the long lost feeling of home

His home ,he remembered ,was present all alone\
With green serene lake surrounding the gardens so long\
Feeling like two lonely islands in the vast unknown\
That they stretched far up till the portion\
Of bridges and dividing fence which was filled with thorns\
And was responsible for dividing the town into two different proportions\
In which lived people of two different notion\
As they argued amongst themselves without coming to conclusions\
But what they never did was resort to violence and vehemance\
As they knew better than to defy their demeanour\
Everyone had their own say and thought \
as nobody felt left out and alone\
such was the wondrous town of McLord

Standing on the docks at nights alone\
He tried to remember the place he once called home\
Which filled him with emotions and tears of his own\
As the new land was nothing compared to the old\
Which gave him a feeling that he belonged \
somewhere ,on this lonely dot globe\
And one thing always remained the same wherever he went \
He was always surrounded by people who liked him most
