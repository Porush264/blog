Once there was a man taller than me\
And I was jealous of the places he had seen\
He had seen everything that the world could present\
But he never showed any signs of pride and arrogance\
As he was more humble and generous than me\
And I was usually the one people called selfish and obscene\
He possessed everything which I fantasized for and liked\
But I had everything which I only despised\
Roamed like a free spirit and never had any regrets\
With men envious of him and women impressed\
He enjoyed company of the girl of his dreams\
But I never could go on more than imagining what could have been\
Embarrassed and ashamed I return to my lonely space\
Hiding in my mind behind the unbearable pain\
But when I see reflection of myself trapped in a cage \
I see the same man who was perfect in every way
