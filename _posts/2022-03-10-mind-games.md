Everyone is playing those mind games\
And do not fear of making themselves the prey\
They give in to their emotions and play with pain\
And do not have a worry of what they give or take\
In these games of politics which wrecks the brain

They say one thing and act on another \
Until they are left with a life of chaos and confusion\
Just to satisfy their pride and egoistic notions\
And their mind does not have time to aimlessly wander\
Wander in the deep sea of unknown and question\
Everything that surrounds in its pristine nature
