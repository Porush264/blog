A tyrant's ego makes the whole world dance \
Dance blindly until it can last\
Last until you bleed from weapons of hate \
And wish it was over before it is too late

Children weep and scream their hearts out\
As they do not understand what this world sought out \
Destruction all around makes you feels so proud \
And cannot comprehend the meaning of life and death now

Before you started the war ,did you contemplate\
Then why you must do so when it is time to pay\
You wanted to be the annihilator, you wanted to be a messiah\
But what you end up becoming is a creator of a world with fire\
You made the way to suffering and agony\
And rolled the dice over the lives of so many
