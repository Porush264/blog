I used to lay in my bed and dream the impossible\
But now I don't have time to delay the inevitable\
As I face the struggles associated with reality\
And bear the pain being inflicted by society\
\
Nobody knows the trouble i've seen\
Cause they only just bother me\
Nobody knows the feelings I cry\
Cause they are trapped inside my mind\
\
This world only sees what it likes to see\
The thing they don't care about becomes your personal dream\
The misery and pain that you feel \
which then becomes so heavy\
That you start to really believe \
It's all your reality \
And you're just a floating body

They might say to you that you're free to dream\
But when you start to imagine \
They stop you in between\
Telling you that it's not worth it to dream

They don't see your pain\
They just see you fail\
They keep reminding you of the greatness you don't have\
They keep forcing you on it until they drive you mad

They just wanna come and tell you \
Success comes to those who know \
That nothing matters about you\
Until you have done something to show\
So let me come out and tell you \
That you can do nothing for yourself\
Which you might believe to be true\
Because then it breaks the order\
By which the world drives through
