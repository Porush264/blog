# **1. A Deep Sleep**

All alone sitting in the emptiness, feeling it. He was lying there thinking 'What has it all come to'?, he saw no purpose in living, no purpose in carrying on, no purpose in putting a happy face, if all of it was just fake. He felt like a fish, swimming in the meaningless sea with no reason to live on .All the while he felt tired and wanted to put the day at end by a deep sleep but knew the harsh reality would not come to an end unless it was a permanent end to his own life. But still he thought to give one last chance to sleep before coming to the end of the road with his life. Tired and wishing that his sleep turns into a permanent one ,he dozed off.\
He was on a hill , surrounded by green ,beautiful hills around him as far as he could see, but this was quite hard for him to believe that he would be dreaming about some place like this while the state he was in at the moment .He walked around a bit looking for some other sign of life but wasn't sure what he was gonna do if he met someone ,as he was not in any mood to talk to someone and was just looking because of nothing to do . Now ,dreams as they do have a tendency to fade and appear ,he suddenly was on a hill where someone who mark knew very well was sitting on the edge of the hill ,all the while attentive of the fact of the danger but not having a worry about it. \
" Hey grandpa ", said Mark, not looking at him as he was not surprised to see him in one of his dreams.\
"Oh, hey ,I suppose you dream too much of me, don't you want your grandpa to have some rest once in a while? ",said his grandpa\
" I could say the same thing about you , whenever I have a dream , you seem to have nothing else to do and just pop in " , said Mark, while taking a seat himself alongside his grandpa \
" You very well know ,though ,for me coming this time ",said his grandpa, looking for the first time towards Mark\
"Yep ,you know, you really should have done a podcast or something when you were alive because you seem to be giving me all your philosophy whether or not I want to hear it", said Mark\
"Seems like you do want to hear it ,otherwise I wouldn't be here ",said his grandpa\
"All right , that's a new record of you boring me, I'm off ",said Mark, standing up to go away as he knew what his grandpa was gonna say and didn't want to hear it \
"Run away from me ,but you can't run from reality, you have to accept this fact and must make your peace with it. Decide when you want to do that in your own time", said his grandpa, finally standing up on the hill.\
"Maybe never", said Mark in finality.\
And as these words settled their place ,the dream started to fade away along with his grandpa, but not into nothingness, into something else.\
he had been here ,Andy's party in which he didn't want to go, but had gone anyway just because it would mean spending more time with Maeve.\
Mark looked around, and found someone who was not supposed to be there\
"What are you thinking, Mark?", asked Maeve\
"Well, for starters, you didn't stay on the roof with me in actuality, I was alone here", said Mark\
"I went inside to party with my friends ,but this is your dream so I guess I'll do what you imagine me to", said Maeve\
I don't know why I'm here ,dreaming this memory", said Mark, abruptly changing the topic.\
"Maybe it's a strong one, you just didn't know it yet", said Maeve\
Now looking down the roof ,"tell you what, I think I might have the answer that is if you are willing to jump for it", said Maeve\
Mark had no problem with that ,after all why would he have a problem doing it in a dream, he certainly wouldn't even mind doing it in reality now. Mark took the hand which Maeve had extended, and together they jumped. As he went down, he felt himself getting lighter and lighter but the scene was changing again and when he landed he saw the hill was back. This was utterly fascinating as he had never seen the hill before in his life.\
"Wonderful place ,isn't it?", said Maeve\
"Why are you here?", said Mark\
"Of course ,to talk about your parents", said Maeve\
"And you know I don't wanna hear anything, then why even try?", said Mark, getting impatient now\
"Life is still worth living Mark, at least give it one more chance", said Maeve\
"I don't feel like living anymore", said Mark \
"Then, I'm afraid I have to say goodbye and let you continue to see for yourself", said Maeve\
"See what?", asked Mark, completely confused\
Almost suddenly, the hills started to crack from middle almost as if they were part of a big animated movie and before he saw it, the land on which Mark stood, split itself into two, leading Mark into the unknown.
