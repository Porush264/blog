The waves were drifting away\
From the eyes of admirers and seekers alike\
It had secrets that could not be made\
But only be unlocked when destiny arrived

Once belonged to a king \
Who had everything he could only dream\
And his kingdom prospered with riches and possessions\
Under the rule of king Ademant ,the king with his most deadly pendant

It arrives on the shore\
Clinging to the hope\
That it does not go\
Unnoticed and left out like before

A child curious by its nature\
Looks at its well-defined, unfaded, caricatures\
Buries it deep again\
Never to resurface till time's eternal end\
So goes the tale of the marvelous lost pendant
