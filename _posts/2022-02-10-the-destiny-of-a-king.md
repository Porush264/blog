A king born with a destiny of gold\
Had only eyes for the unappealing coal\
But nobody cared which he wanted more\
As he was thrown in with the aristocrats when born

Though, when he met the mistress of the lord\
He found that she had similar interests of her own\
To leave the life of luxury and start anew\
and start a life in countryside elsewhere

She wanted the life of a writer\
And he wanted something to be as simple as a farmer\
And when they met , they both became much lighter\
When both came to know\
that each of them were looking for something mundane\
But lacked company of someone they could never hate\
and a place where together they could fly away

And so it seemed it was bound to be a happy ending\
Until came the dreaded storm of illness and fate\
Which took away the woman along with his purpose of living\
Alone again he never understood what was to be made\
Of this life which now seemed to him never-ending

He returned to his kingdom in order to fill the void \
With life of fortune which he never could vacate\
And he freed the people of his kingdom from their ongoing turmoil\
As he fit the role which he was always destined to take
