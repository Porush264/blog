# War

* As long as mankind has existed
* It has fought among itself for vengeance or riches
* For conflict comes from thirst for revenge 
* Which is born from pain and cannot be quenched


* Some say the hardships of war bring them glory and fame
* But some feel remorse when they talk of their great pain
* And then they teach their young ones to do the same 
* To follow the cycle of war until they are in the lifeâ€™s play


* It leaves us with nothing but misery and regret
* Which keeps feeding to the rage that was long suppressed 
* And so the time comes when the cycle is to be followed again 
* Of blood and war which is written in pain
