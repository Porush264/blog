T﻿here were cries of the cordane battle heard in every land \
B﻿lood spilled,famillies killed,\
tyrants hanged like scarecrows in fields\
N﻿one had surrendered,none could remember \
B﻿leak fog of dusts were existing forever\
\
B﻿odies lay surrounding like stars in the night sky\
B﻿ut what will become of them now \
W﻿ill they be remembered by a soul \
W﻿ho was left out of this cataclysmic war \
A﻿gainst humanity which seeks to destroy its own\
W﻿hatever it may cost or whatever be the odds

What should have been part \
O﻿f this great humane history \
H﻿as now been lost \
I﻿n the rubbles of great mysteries 

W﻿hat must have they gained or lost?\
I﻿n this great battle which tore apart them all
