There were cries of the cordane battle heard in every land \
Blood spilled,famillies killed,\
tyrants hanged like scarecrows in fields\
None had surrendered,none could remember \
Bleak fog of dusts were existing forever\
\
Bodies lay surrounding like stars in the night sky\
But what will become of them now \
Will they be remembered by a soul \
Who was left out of this cataclysmic war \
Against humanity which seeks to destroy its own\
Whatever it may cost or whatever be the odds

What should have been part \
Of this great humane history \
Has now been lost \
In the rubbles of great mysteries 

What must have they gained or lost?\
In this great battle which tore apart them all
